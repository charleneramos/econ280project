This ReadMe file summarizes the programs and data files included in the
data repository. See the Online Appendix file IdeaPFDataAppendix.pdf for
details and replication instructions. Data sets (sources, files, and
instructions for obtaining the data) are discussed in detail in the
online appendix.

Files formats:
*.m   = matlab programs
*.mat = matlab data files
*.xls = data spreadsheets
*.csv = data CSV files

MasterIdeaPF.m: Master program for all results other than Census

Note: The first time you run MasterIdeaPF.m, most results will show up
quickly. The CompuStat data, however, gets cleaned in CompustatRead.m
and this takes ~10 minutes, so the program will appear to pause when
that happens.

itfp.do: Stata program for Census results

Subdirectories:
   Aggregate/   = Aggregate U.S. 
   Compustat/   = Compustat firm-level 
   ChadMatlab/  = various general matlab functions
   MooresLaw/   = Moore's law case
   Mortality/   = Mortality rate cases
   Pharma/      = New Molecular entities case
   Seeds/       = Agriculture and seed cases
   Patents/     = Patent data used to allocate R&D in Moore's Law
   WageSci/     = Wage deflators for converting R&D into effective research   


Guide to Figures and Tables
---------------------------

Figures are stored as *.eps files. Program output is saved in *.log
files. The appendage "_Main" is used for the main results. The appendage
"_Lambda" is used for the robustness results in Appendix Table A1.

The programs listed below should not be run individually but instead
called by MasterIdeaPF.m.
