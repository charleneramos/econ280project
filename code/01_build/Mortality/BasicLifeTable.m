%   Age-adjust based on the year 2000
%     -- Add up lx in the year 2000 to get a total number of people N (e.g. > age 50)

%     -- qx = death rate at each age (also = dx/lx)
%     -- Compute age-adjusted average death rate as Sum(qx*weight)
%     This gives the average age-adjusted death rate for ages 50+...
