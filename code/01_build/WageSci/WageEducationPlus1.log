    Add 1% to WageEducation.m for robustness
 
    Note well: Any wage program should save the following three variables
      WageYears= e.g. (1929:2015)'
      WageScientist=NominalGDPperPerson;
      WageNotes={'Currently using Nominal GDP per Person from NIPA for the wage deflator'}
    into the .mat file WageScientistData.mat
 
    That way we can easily change the wage deflator by just running a different wage program
    and then rerunning the idea TFP programs.
