\noindent {\textbf{\color{blue}Description of Extension}}

\smallskip

\noindent In Bloom et al. (2020), the authors use mean personal income from the Current Population Survey for males with a bachelor's degree or more of education to estimate the effective number of researchers. This variable is of particular interest for growth accounting purposes, since idea-based models examine economic growth as the byproduct of research productivity and number of researchers. The extension proposed here deflates gross domestic investment by a measure of the nominal wage considering high-skilled workers with a doctorate degree only. Although the majority of researchers presumably hold a bachelor's degree, many of them probably earned graduate degrees as well, which usually command higher wages in the labor market. Replacing such values from 1991 through 2014 results in a significant downward adjustment, with factor increase since 1930 becoming less steep, which suggests that Bloom et al. (2020) may be overestimating research effort by capturing less heterogeneity than available.
